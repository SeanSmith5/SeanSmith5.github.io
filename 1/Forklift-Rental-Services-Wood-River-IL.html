Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well.

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability.

<p>With the test load elevated to maximum height, and for trucks with tilting up 4 rights without change in the original overhang dimensions, the test platform shall be tipped to the specified slope. Skid steers, excavators, dump trailers, tractors, lifts and shredders are just some of the types of heavy equipment we offer to help you with whatever the job requires.</p>
