<p>For the same loadcapacity, forklifts differ in 3 main ways. This includes Forklift tyres, Spares and Pallet Jacksat competitive prices. Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery.

Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
