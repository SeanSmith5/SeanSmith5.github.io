<p>Like the LHM230P, the BT Pro Lifter, LHT100 is designed to work with minimal starting force for increased productivity during horizontal transport and loading operations. However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>Additionally, dealerships can warranty the work they do on their own vehicles - even lift kits. The capacity of a truck equipped with load carriage and forks, or with attachments is the maximum weight, expressed in pounds, at a specified load center, which a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable, on 406 of this Standard, can lift to the maximum elevation of the load engaging means.</p>
