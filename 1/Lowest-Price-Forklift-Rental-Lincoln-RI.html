The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>
<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>

The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>
