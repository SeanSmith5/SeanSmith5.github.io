Inquire about leasing any of our new and pre-owned or used forklifts. With our used forklifts, we can offer up to 36 months on a $1 buyout lease option. Forklifts vary in how high they can lift a load. Pneumatic tires: Designed for heavy-duty lifting and outdoor operation, a gasoline or diesel lift truck with pneumatic tires has the same functionality as a standard car or truck.</p>
<p>By having one that is already lifted, you'll be able to resell your truck faster and get more money for it than you would if it weren't already lifted. Switching offer for electric forklift trucks. These lift trucks can be controlled with a steering tiller, which often features several controls mounted on top. Cushion tired forklifts are intended to be used indoors on smooth floors.</p>
<p>Report damaged or excessively worn pallet jacks. Choose a jack pallet scale from METTLER TOLEDO that will withstand regularly heavy industrial use. The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>

Since jacks are often electric, with some training, the same weight that is putting your employees at risk for injuries is moved with a touch of a button. The unit is compatible with all types of forklifts so that you can easily move within your facilities.</p>

At the same time, reach trucks offer very high acceleration as well as impressive lift and reach speeds, which in turn ensures excellent throughput performance. There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>

Forklifts come in many sizes and capacities. Each type of forklift truck requires its own training course, and each of these courses are offered at various levels and by numerous accrediting bodies.</p>

<p>Simply pick up the mobile unit with any kind of forklift or truck and drive wherever you need to go. Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipment—that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area.
