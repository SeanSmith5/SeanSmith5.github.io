<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items. Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>
<p>Lift kits can put added pressure on the driveshaft angles , causing intense vibrations at peak speeds. If you require an order picking forklift that can utilised for high racking situations, we have a range that can complete these tasks with ease.
