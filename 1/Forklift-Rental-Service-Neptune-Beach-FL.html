<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>
