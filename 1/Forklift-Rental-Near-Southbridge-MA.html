<h3>Interesting Forklift Facts and History in Southbridge MA 01550</h3>
<p>By control, by type, by load capacity, by end use industry and by region, to offer insights on the global Pallet Trucks market. Rough terrain forklift operation requires the driver to be constantly aware of the ground surface conditions in the direction of movement, and requires focused attention at every phase of the task at hand. In such scenarios, Forklift Trucks play an important role in the food and beverage industry.</p>

The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
