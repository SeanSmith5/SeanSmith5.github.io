<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>

Integral sideshift allows sideways movement of the forks to handle loads that may not be aligned with the truck.
