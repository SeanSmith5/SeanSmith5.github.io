<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck.

<p>Load and unload pallets on and off trucks. I used to say, If it has forks on it and you're lifting up pallets, it's covered by the forklift standard.” But that's not 100% true anymore. Raymond counterbalanced sit down forklift trucks can use specialized load handling attachments such as slip sheets, and carton clamps. It is therefore essential to know the exact capacity and safety features of the specific forklift you are handling.</p>
