<h2>Electric Pallet Jack Oak Hill</h2>
<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>

While these two lift kits are somewhat similar, there are important differences between them. This will provide them with the necessary certifications to be able to use forklifts legally in their job. Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>
