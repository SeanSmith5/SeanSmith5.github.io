Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines.

Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors. Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind.</p>
