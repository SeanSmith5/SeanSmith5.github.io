We can confidently provide you with a brand new forklift, a quality used machine, a forklift rental or excellent service regardless of where in SA you are based.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Container handlers are manufactured in many configurations including overhead crane-style handlers, as well as traditional vertical and telescopic mast type forklifts. Come to our location and check out truck brands like Chevy , GMC , Ford , and Ram that have lift kits included.
