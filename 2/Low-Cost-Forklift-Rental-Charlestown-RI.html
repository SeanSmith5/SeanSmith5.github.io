<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<p>Delta Electronics launched a 30kW wireless battery charging system, which can charge a 600Ahr-48V battery in just 60 minutes, making it ideal for large and complex vehicles, such as scissor lifts, forklifts, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and more. The air springs will provide load support for your truck and will automatically inflate or deflate with air pressure based on the load you are attempting to carry.</p>
<p>Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing.

Our forklift rental programme is backed by the strength and flexibility of our branch network. The difference is that only the mast moves and not the front tires like an articulated forklift.</p>
<p>Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 pounds rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties. Weight Scale's easy to weigh, easy to move & easy to lift quality wheels provide for easy maneuvering on rough terrain and an ideal solution for any warehouse that demands specific and mobile weighing id critical.</p>

Operators of the Flexi truck are required to hold a certificate of training which shows they have attended a training course and passed a test to a set national standard.</p>
<p>Side Loader popularity has been declining due to the more advanced multi-directional forklift that has taken its place as the king of long load handling. We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>
