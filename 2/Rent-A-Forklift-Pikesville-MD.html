Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>RT forklift manufacturers—and there are more than you might think, some with surprisingly broad product lines—are pursuing ongoing refinement of their machines. Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>

From construction sites and builder's yards, to special event venues and timber forestry sites, by being so adaptable a rough terrain forklift can maximise on productivity and efficiency.</p>
