<h3>Forklift Ramps Bangor ME</h3>
<p>Forklift Sales Botswana started over 15 years ago, when we took on the TOYOTA Forklift Dealer, and since then we have a current, estimated 80% share of the Botswana Forklift Market. Their rental fleet is worth around $1.5 billion. From the smallest, lightest loads in retail environments to the heaviest SKUs in the highest distribution centers, our trucks can handle any order picking application and help you get the most out of every operator, every shift, every day.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice. Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors. Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind.</p>
<p>The Industrial Truck Association (ITA) is responsible for defining the classification of the industrial Forklift Trucks and also is responsible for imposing a set of rules and regulations on the industries using the Forklift Trucks. We pride ourselves on providing a wide variety of equipment options for every application, while our full service branch offers used equipment sales, short and long term rentals, emergency and preventative maintenance.</p>

Elevating forks allow for easy placement of picked items onto the pallet, whilst the walk-through version allows the handling of bulky loads, enhancing operator comfort and efficiency. In addition to 4WD forklifts and Sellick's poultry handlers , we occasionally have a used rough terrain forklift for sale.</p>
