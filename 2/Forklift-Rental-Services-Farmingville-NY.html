<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain. When you rent a forklift from Gregory Poole Lift Systems, you get the adaptability you need from your forklift fleet, without a huge impact on your bottom line. Many lifted truck owners purchased standard vehicles and later make modifications to them, either by themselves or with the help of a mechanic.</p>

<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents.

<p>United Rentals is an Authorized Dealer for Motorola and can provide a variety of handheld and portable radio solutions. These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications.
