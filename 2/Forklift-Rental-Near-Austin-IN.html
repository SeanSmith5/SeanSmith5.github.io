Access Hire Australia have a range of rough terrain forklifts for hire to suit your needs including various operating weights, lift capacities and dimensions.

<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. DaytonÂ® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability.

The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet. These kinds of lift kits are popular because no work is necessary to adjust the suspension or other mechanical systems on the truck.

<p>In a bizarre incident captured on surveillance cameras, strong winds lifted a truck off the ground and flipped it around on its front wheel before slamming it back on the road. Truck drivers from the Richardson and Garland regions won't believe the lifted trucks and 4x4 conversion trucks on sale right now at Young Chevrolet in Dallas.
