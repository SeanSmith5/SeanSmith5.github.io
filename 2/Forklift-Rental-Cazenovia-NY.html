<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift. Before you select any hydraulic pump, however, there are several important pieces of information to take into consideration that will help you match it with the right hydraulic tool, cylinder, or equipment.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up.
