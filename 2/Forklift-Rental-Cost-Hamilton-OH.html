<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>This system is a result of the various types of forklift training available. In addition, the use of a powered industrial truck in a location for which that type of powered industrial truck is not designated for use, for example due to a flammable atmosphere, can result in a fire or explosion. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
<p>JCB - dependable performance meets exceptional value with JCB's line of rough terrain forklifts. OSHA has developed several training, compliance assistance, and health and safety recognition programs throughout its history. Masts are built based on the lifting height provided and can be: double, with two telescopic bodies that extend when lifting begins; double with full free lifting, in which, unlike for the previous type, the telescopic mast does not extend until the fork has been completely raised; and triple, with three telescopic bodies.</p>

Particularly in confined conditions, our electric reach trucks set new benchmarks thanks to their compact construction and outstanding lifting capacity.</p>
<p>Heavy Metal Learning is designed to provide educational content on how to operate heavy equipment; a forum for operators and industry supporters to share their knowledge; an opportunity to get out in the field; and ultimately inspiring the next generation. As with any other vehicle, trucks make statements. Braking applied with the handle in an upright and horizontal position, increases the safety of the truck while a built-in pressure relief valve protects the electric reach stacker from overloads, increasing the reliability.</p>
