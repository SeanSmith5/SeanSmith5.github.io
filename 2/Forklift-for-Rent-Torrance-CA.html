<p>Essentially, rough terrain forklifts are built to be durable. Today they have become ubiquitous on construction sites due to their ability to haul loads and then extend them out for delivery. Rough-terrain forklifts are ideal for construction sites because they can handle everything from loose dirt to finished flooring.

This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts are probably the most common forklift trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores in the Vancouver area. While it's true that safety officials (OSHA) are more likely to inspect large commercial jobsites than residential or multifamily ones, they will visit any site where incidents have occurred or where complaints have been made.
