<p>Common industries that use these types of forklifts include lumber yards, metal yards, and shipping ports. Class six forklifts can utilize either internal combustion engines for outdoor use or battery powered electric motors for indoor use. First, there are many types of rental forklifts available so do your homework and make sure you get a rental unit well suited to your particular job.</p>
<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation. We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>

As a result, with the adoption of advanced technology, there are substantial market opportunities, owing to the efforts of the manufacturers that are indulged in manufacturing forklift trucks that are technologically driven.</p>
