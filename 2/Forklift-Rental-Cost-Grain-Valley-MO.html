Are you looking for a used lifted 4Ã—4 truck for sale, if so, then you came to the right place. This class includes reach trucks, in which the operator guides the fork to reach up and grab pallets, and order pickers, in which the operator platform can be raised and lowered to grab individual items when putting together an order.</p>
