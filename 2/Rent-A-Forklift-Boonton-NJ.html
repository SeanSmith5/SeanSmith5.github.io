<h3>Industrial Lift Truck Operation Boonton NJ 07005</h3>
<p>Simply put, a pallet jack is a large tool used to lift and move heavy pallets. Along with selling new and used forklifts, ProLift offers forklift rentals Using a rental is ideal when the need for a forklift is limited - as short as 1 day - or you have a sudden or unexpected need. We provide the best Warranty in the business and can offer outstanding Lease & Finance packages.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
